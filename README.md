# Horiseon - Marketing Agency
### ~ Code Refactor Starter Code ðŸŽ¨

## Description

 This challenge thought me about the right structure an html and css files have to have in order to be considered accessible.
 A site that is accessible ensures that people with disabilities can access it with special technologies, apart from providing better positioning in the google search engines!
 
 The previous verision of the site was missing some semantic structure in the html, and the css could be refactored to reduce the lines of code and way of applying the rules.
 I followed the Scout Rule, to make sure that the new code provided (refactored) is cleaner than how it was before.

Access the deployed project here: https://lilianpatinoortiz.github.io/Horiseon-CodeRefactor-Agency/

## Usage

After running the project you will be able to access the refactored site! 
You might be wondering why you can barely see any difference compared to the old version of the site, and that is because usually that's what a refactor is.
A refactor consists on restructuring an existing body, just altering the internal structure without changing the functionality. Basically its improving the quality of the code base!
Below is an image of what you should be seing when you run the project or access the deployment.
